## Abstract:

The constant improvement of the tennis racquet has accelerated the pace of tennis to where 130 mph serves are commonplace. Height has given an edge to the top players who are adapting to this new speed, implementing the serve as a critical part of their game. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of body height on several performance factors in elite male tennis players. The data used contains all recorded ATP matches from 1968 to 2021. The data set contains crucial performance factors such as 1st serve in, 1st serve won, breakpoints faced, breakpoints saved, etc.. To analyze the data, I used data sets, graphing, and statistical analyses. The results indicated that ranking and serve related match outcomes that exhibit considerable variation according to playersâ€™ stature and court surface.
